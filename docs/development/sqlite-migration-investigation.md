# SQLite Migration Investigation Report

## Executive Summary

**Current Setup:** PostgreSQL via Supabase with Prisma ORM
**Recommendation:** ‚ùå DO NOT MIGRATE - High Risk Issues Present

## Current Database Analysis

### Database Configuration
- **Provider:** postgresql
- **Models:** 19
- **Relationships:** 18
- **Complex Features:** 2

### Supabase Usage Assessment
- **Direct Supabase Usage:** No ‚úÖ
- **Prisma-only Database Access:** Yes ‚úÖ
- **Files Referencing Supabase:** 1

## PostgreSQL Features Analysis

### JSON Fields (9)
- stats
- cryptoWallet
- objectives
- rewardItems
- statBoosts
- progress
- details
- details
- eventData

### Arrays (16)
- assets
- gangs
- ledGangs
- inventory
- actionLogs
- robberies
- missions
- leaderboards
- moneyEvents
- bankTransactions
- cryptoTransactions
- members
- inventories
- robberyLogs
- upgrades
- userMissions

### UUIDs
‚úÖ Used (compatible with SQLite)

## Migration Complexity Assessment

### üî¥ High Risk Items (1)
- PostgreSQL array fields not supported in SQLite

### üü° Medium Risk Items (3)
- JSON fields need testing: stats, cryptoWallet, objectives, rewardItems, statBoosts, progress, details, details, eventData
- Complex relationship graph may need careful migration
- Transactions need testing for SQLite compatibility

### üü¢ Low Risk Items (4)
- Prisma ORM provides good abstraction
- UUID support available in SQLite with cuid() or uuid()
- Basic CRUD operations should work identically
- Discord bot single-instance deployment suits SQLite well

## Performance Implications

### SQLite Advantages
- Zero-latency local file access
- No network round trips
- Simplified deployment (single file)
- No external dependencies
- Built-in backup (file copy)
- Excellent read performance for single-user scenarios

### SQLite Disadvantages
- Limited concurrent write performance
- No built-in user management
- File corruption risks
- Manual backup strategies required
- Limited scalability for multiple concurrent Discord servers

## Migration Effort Estimate

### Code Changes Required
- **Prisma Schema:** Update provider from "postgresql" to "sqlite"
- **Environment Variables:** Replace DATABASE_URL with local SQLite file path
- **JSON Field Testing:** Verify all JSON operations work correctly
- **Transaction Testing:** Ensure all Prisma transactions work with SQLite
- **Migration Scripts:** Create data migration scripts from PostgreSQL to SQLite

### Testing Required
- **Full Test Suite:** Run all existing tests against SQLite
- **Performance Testing:** Benchmark Discord bot response times
- **Concurrent Load Testing:** Test multiple simultaneous Discord interactions
- **Data Integrity Testing:** Verify complex relationships and constraints

### Deployment Changes
- **Backup Strategy:** Implement SQLite file backup procedures
- **Monitoring:** Add SQLite-specific health checks and monitoring
- **Recovery Procedures:** Document SQLite corruption recovery steps

## Recommendation: ‚ùå DO NOT MIGRATE - High Risk Issues Present


**Why not to migrate:**
The presence of 1 high-risk compatibility issues makes this migration too risky for the expected benefits. Focus on optimizing PostgreSQL performance instead.

**Alternative optimizations:**
- Implement connection pooling
- Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize slow queries identified in the codebase
- Consider read replicas for better performance


## Next Steps


1. **Focus on PostgreSQL optimization** instead of migration
2. **Implement caching strategies** for frequently accessed data
3. **Profile and optimize slow queries** in the current setup
4. **Consider connection pooling** to reduce connection overhead
