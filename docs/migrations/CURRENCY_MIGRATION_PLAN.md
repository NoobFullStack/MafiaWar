- [x] Implemented dry-run and rollback capabilities

## âœ… Phase 3: Hybrid Service Implementation (COMPLETE)
- [x] Developed `MoneyServiceV2` with full API compatibility
- [x] Implemented hybrid read/write capabilities
- [x] Added automatic migration state detection

- [x] Added missing methods for full compatibility

## ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Production Migration (READY)
- [ ] Run migration script on production data
- [ ] Validate data integrity
- [ ] Monitor system performance
- [ ] Complete rollback preparation

## ðŸ”„ Phase 6: Legacy Cleanup (PENDING)
- [ ] Remove deprecated Character table columns
- [ ] Remove original MoneyService
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Migration Commands

```bash
# Test hybrid service functionality
yarn test:money-service-v2

# Run migration dry run
yarn migrate:currency

# Run actual migration (when ready)
yarn migrate:currency --apply
```

## Rollback Strategy

If issues are discovered:
1. MoneyServiceV2 automatically falls back to Character table columns
2. No data is lost during migration
3. Original MoneyService can be quickly restored
4. Migration can be reversed with validation

## Data Integrity Guarantees

- All operations wrapped in database transactions
- Comprehensive validation before and after migration
- Zero data loss commitment
- Audit trail preservation
- Backwards compatibility maintained
