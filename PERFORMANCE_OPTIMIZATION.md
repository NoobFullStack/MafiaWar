# Performance Optimization Summary

## Issue Resolution
Fixed slow command execution times in production (reduced from 3-5 seconds to target <1 second).

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Database Query Optimization
- **Single Query User Resolution**: Created `getUserForCommand()` method that fetches user data with all required relations in one query instead of multiple separate queries
- **Optimized Prisma Configuration**: Added production-specific settings for better performance
- **Reduced Query Complexity**: Streamlined include clauses to only fetch necessary fields

### 2. Caching Layer Implementation
- **Static Data Caching**: Added `CacheManager` utility for frequently accessed static data (crime data, crypto prices)
- **Crypto Price Caching**: Implemented 2-minute cache for crypto price lookups to avoid repeated database hits
- **Available Crimes Caching**: Cache filtered crime lists by player level (5-minute TTL)

### 3. Parallel Operations
- **Profile Command**: Parallelized balance fetching and bank tier calculations
- **Async Operations**: Use Promise.all() for independent database operations that can run concurrently

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- **Execution Time Logging**: Added timing measurements for all commands with slow query warnings
- **Database Query Timing**: Track individual query performance with alerts for queries >500ms
- **Command Performance Metrics**: Log execution times for commands >2 seconds

## Performance Improvements Expected

### Before Optimization:
- Commands: 3-5 seconds
- Multiple sequential database queries per command
- No caching of static data
- No performance monitoring

### After Optimization:
- Commands: <1 second target
- Single optimized query per command where possible
- Cached static data (crimes, crypto prices)
- Performance monitoring and alerting

## Files Modified

### Core Infrastructure:
- `src/utils/DatabaseManager.ts` - Added optimized user resolution methods
- `src/utils/CacheManager.ts` - New caching layer
- `src/bot.ts` - Added performance timing and monitoring

### Services:
- `src/services/MoneyService.ts` - Added crypto price caching
- `src/services/CrimeService.ts` - Added crime data caching and optimized user lookup

### Commands:
- `src/commands/profile.ts` - Optimized to use single query + parallel operations
- `src/commands/crime.ts` - Updated to use optimized user resolution

## Monitoring Commands

To monitor performance in production:
1. Check logs for "Slow command execution" warnings
2. Monitor "Slow getUserForCommand query" messages
3. Track cache hit/miss ratios in development mode

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility:
- Original methods are kept with `@deprecated` tags
- Existing command interfaces unchanged
- Database schema unchanged
