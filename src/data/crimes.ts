/**
 * CRIME DATA CONFIGURATION
 *
 * This file defines all available crimes in the Mafia War bot game.
 * Each crime has been carefully balanced for optimal risk/reward progression.
 *
 * BALANCE PHILOSOPHY:
 * - Higher difficulty = Higher risk (longer jail time, lower success rate)
 * - Higher difficulty = Higher reward (more money, more XP)
 * - Logical progression from street crimes to organized operations
 * - Success rates decrease as difficulty increases (95% â†’ 15%)
 * - Jail times scale exponentially with crime severity
 * - XP rewards scale with both difficulty and time investment
 * - Cooldowns balance frequency vs reward potential
 *
 * Crime Categories & Progression:
 * - petty (Lv 1-5): Street-level crimes, high success, low risk/reward
 * - theft (Lv 3-10): Property crimes, moderate risk/reward
 * - white_collar (Lv 8-15): Tech crimes, lower violence risk, crypto payments
 * - robbery (Lv 12-20): Violent crimes, higher risk/reward
 * - organized (Lv 18-25): Syndicate operations, massive risk/reward
 * - violence (Lv 25+): Elite operations, extreme risk/reward
 *
 * Payment Types Logic:
 * - cash: Street crimes, immediate small amounts
 * - bank: Laundered funds from organized operations
 * - crypto: Tech crimes and assassination contracts
 * - mixed: Complex operations with multiple revenue streams
 *
 * Success Rate Formula: 95% - (difficulty * 8%) = realistic crime success rates
 * Jail Time Formula: Base minutes * (difficulty^1.5) = escalating consequences
 * XP Formula: (difficulty * 8) + (cooldown_minutes / 10) = time investment rewards
 * Reward Formula: Base amount * (difficulty^1.3) = exponential reward scaling
